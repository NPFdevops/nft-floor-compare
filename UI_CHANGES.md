# UI/UX Changes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Default Layout Changed to Stacked**
- ✅ Changed default layout from `horizontal` to `vertical` (stacked)
- ✅ Updated `App.jsx` to initialize layout as `'vertical'` by default
- ✅ Modified chart rendering logic to always use stacked layout
- ✅ Removed the conditional logic for side-by-side vs stacked charts

### 2. **Hidden Layout Toggle Button**
- ✅ Completely removed the Layout Controls section from `App.jsx`
- ✅ Removed unused `LayoutToggle` import
- ✅ Users can no longer switch between horizontal and vertical layouts

### 3. **Moved Screenshot and Share Buttons**
- ✅ **Before**: Buttons were in the Layout Controls section (top-right)
- ✅ **After**: Moved to be centered below the charts section
- ✅ Positioned between Charts and Collection Metrics
- ✅ Maintained responsive design (stacked on mobile, inline on desktop)

### 4. **Hidden Selected Collection Display**
- ✅ **Before**: SearchBar showed a colored box below the input with selected collection name and ranking
- ✅ **After**: This display is completely hidden
- ✅ Collection names still appear in the search input field
- ✅ Clear functionality still works via the 'X' button in the input

### 5. **Collection Name Highlighting with Chart Colors**
- ✅ **Chart Colors Used**:
  - Collection 1: `#e91e63` (Pink)
  - Collection 2: `#9c27b0` (Purple)

- ✅ **PriceBanner Component**:
  - Collection names appear in colored badges in the main text
  - Loading state also shows colored collection names
  - "*The price of [Pink Badge: Bored Ape] would be X ETH with the market cap of [Purple Badge: CryptoPunks]*"

- ✅ **CollectionMetrics Component**:
  - Column headers show collection names in colored badges instead of "Collection 1/2"
  - Consistent with chart color scheme

## Visual Impact

### Before
- Layout toggle button was visible
- Screenshot/Share buttons were in the top controls area
- Selected collections showed in boxes below search inputs
- Collection names appeared as plain text
- Default layout was horizontal (side-by-side)

### After
- Clean, streamlined interface with no layout switching
- Screenshot/Share buttons are prominently placed after viewing charts
- Search inputs are cleaner without selection boxes
- Collection names are color-coded throughout the app
- Always shows stacked comparison chart by default

## Maintained Functionality
- ✅ All swap collection functionality still works
- ✅ Price projection calculations unchanged
- ✅ Collection metrics comparison unchanged  
- ✅ Chart functionality and data display unchanged
- ✅ URL sharing and screenshot capabilities unchanged
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness maintained
- ✅ All existing APIs and data fetching unchanged

## Color Consistency
The color highlighting creates visual consistency between:
- Chart legend colors
- PriceBanner collection names  
- CollectionMetrics headers
- All components use the same pink (#e91e63) and purple (#9c27b0) scheme

This creates a cohesive visual experience where users can easily identify which collection is which across all components.

# Navigation and Title Changes

## Changes Made

### 1. **Added H1 Page Title**
- ✅ Added "Collection Comparison" as a prominent H1 title
- ✅ Positioned after breadcrumb navigation, before search controls
- ✅ Responsive sizing:
  - Mobile: `text-3xl` (30px)
  - Tablet: `text-4xl` (36px) 
  - Desktop: `text-5xl` (48px)
- ✅ Center-aligned and bold styling
- ✅ 32px bottom margin for proper spacing

### 2. **Reordered Navigation Items**
- ✅ **New Order**: Rankings → Drops → Strategies → Compare
- ✅ **Previous Order**: Rankings → Drops → Compare → Strategies
- ✅ Applied to both desktop and mobile navigation
- ✅ "Compare" moved to the end as the current active page

### 3. **Navigation Consistency**
